# The Art of Risk: Building a Value-at-Risk (VaR) Model in Python
For [Medium.com Gradient Growth](https://medium.com/gradient-growth)

In this project, we dive into the realm of financial risk management and demonstrate how to construct a Value-at-Risk (VaR) model using Python. VaR is a statistical technique used to quantify the level of financial risk within a firm or investment portfolio over a specific time frame.

## Overview

1. **Decoding the Value-at-Risk (VaR):** Here, we discuss what VaR is, its purpose, and its limitations in risk management.

2. **Crafting a VaR Model in Python:**
   - We demonstrate how to build a VaR model using Python, a powerful language with a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools specifically designed for data analysis and financial modeling.
   - The process involves the following steps:
     - Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
     - Portfolio Returns Calculation
     - Portfolio Mean and Standard Deviation Determination
     - VaR Model Application

## Python Libraries Used

1. `pandas`: For data manipulation
2. `numpy`: For numerical computations
3. `yfinance`: To pull in historical market data
4. `scipy.stats`: To compute the inverse of the cumulative distribution function of a normal distribution
5. `matplotlib.pyplot`: For data visualization

## Conclusion

Risk management is not just an accessory in the world of trading; it's a vital necessity. VaR, despite its limitations, is an integral part of this protective gear. The Python script provided allows you to calculate and visualize the VaR of your portfolio, thus aiding in better financial decision-making.
